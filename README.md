### Overview

South Africa is a multicultural society that is characterised by its rich linguistic diversity. Language is an indispensable tool that can be used to deepen democracy and also contribute to the social, cultural, intellectual, economic and political life of the South African society.

The country is multilingual with 11 official languages, each of which is guaranteed equal status. Most South Africans are multilingual and able to speak at least two or more of the official languages.

With such a multilingual population, it is only obvious that the South African systems and devices should also be able to communicate in multi-languages.

Hence, I will be creating a Machine Learning Model which will take text which is in any of South Africa's 11 Official languages and identify which language the text is in. The goal of the model is to determining the natural language that a piece of text is written in.


### Problem Statement

Based on the linguistic diversity of the South African society, Having a model that can translate accurately any piece of text to it's required natural language, will go a long way in bridging the communication gap in any of her systems, encouraging inclusion and diversity, and finally enhanced productivity.
